# project summary
- analzing Minneapolis' 2040 zone change goals

# project reflection
- cleaning the data was tedious
- but the buggest challeging was having low computing power to process these data
- I really like to try learnign if i coudl find any insights in these data and hopefully learn something

# project solution reflection
- one thing that went well was that I was ableto process the data the way I intended and display them in the most intuitive charts as possible.
- one disadvantage of my solution is that it still isn't the most in depth analysis of the change. I was only able to study what buldings will be repurposed by 2040 but it doesn't tell what kind of business may be affect from these changes. maybe with more kinds of data, we could evaluate and analyze more things.

# coding practises.
- i tried to reuse code as much as possible by putting the into functions so that the functions can be called multiple times throughout the notebook
- however sometimes there are some repetition of codes like re-naming and retitling every graphs I have drawn
- my naming conditions were moderately informative 
- and my graphs were properly labeled to be easily understood

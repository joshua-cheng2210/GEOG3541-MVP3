# Minneapolis Zoning Districts & Built‑Form Tiers

## Table 1 – Zoning District Summaries

| Zone Code | Zone Name | Purpose | Key Characteristics |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| R1 | Multiple‑Family District (Low Density) | Provide for a predominantly low‑density residential environment of single‑, two‑, and three‑family homes. | Up to 3 dwelling units per lot (single‑family, duplex, triplex); primarily small‑scale residential uses. Compatible institutional, public, and utility uses allowed. |
| R1A | Multiple‑Family District (Low Density) | Same intent as R1 in areas with slightly smaller lots. | Small‑scale residential buildings up to 3 units; low‑intensity character similar to R1. |
| R2 | Multiple‑Family District (Low Density) | Low‑density residential uses in a context slightly denser than R1. | Up to 3 units per lot; maintains low‑rise residential character, suitable for duplexes/triplexes. |
| R2B | Multiple‑Family District (Low Density) | Comparable to R2 in older neighborhoods with smaller lots. | Supports single‑ to three‑family dwellings; similar standards to R2. |
| R3 | Multiple‑Family District (Low/Medium Density) | Predominantly small‑scale multifamily housing. | Mix from single‑family to small apartment buildings; moderate density increase over R2. |
| R4 | Multiple‑Family District (Medium Density) | Medium‑density residential such as apartments and congregate living. | Allows apartment buildings about 3–4 stories; greater bulk than R3 yet residential in scale. |
| R5 | Multiple‑Family District (High Density) | High‑density residential living including mid‑rise apartments. | Larger apartment buildings; high unit counts; often located on transit corridors. |
| R6 | Multiple‑Family District (Very High Density) | Highest‑density residential outside downtown. | Allows high‑rise residential towers where built‑form tier permits; very high unit density. |
| OR1 | Neighborhood Office Residence | Mixed low/moderate‑density housing with small professional offices. | Transitional zone: small offices integrated with residential buildings; limited retail. |
| OR2 | High‑Density Office Residence | Mixed moderate/high‑density housing and larger offices. | Multi‑story offices, high‑density residential; small‑scale retail/service uses permitted. |
| OR3 | Institutional Office Residence | Very high‑density housing, large offices, and institutional campuses. | Supports hospitals, universities, large office complexes with residential components. |
| C1 | Neighborhood Commercial | Small‑scale retail & services compatible with nearby homes. | Low‑rise (1–2 stories) shops/cafés; may include upper‑floor housing; neighborhood focus. |
| C2 | Neighborhood Corridor Commercial | Larger‑scale retail and services serving a broader area. | Mixed‑use; supermarkets, restaurants, multi‑tenant strips; pedestrian‑oriented corridors. |
| C3A | Community Activity Center | Major urban activity & entertainment centers with diverse mix. | Mid/high‑rise mixed‑use; shopping, entertainment, offices, high‑density housing. |
| C3S | Community Shopping Center | Large retail centers with ample parking (big‑box focus). | Auto‑oriented shopping complexes; extensive surface parking; minimal residential. |
| I1 | Light Industrial | Low‑impact, tech‑based light industrial & R&D uses. | Clean operations, limited noise/odor; interior warehousing; accessory offices/retail. |
| I2 | Medium Industrial | General industrial with moderate impacts. | Manufacturing, food processing, fabrication; outdoor activity allowed with mitigation. |
| I3 | General Industrial | Heavy or outdoor industrial uses with substantial impacts. | Bulk storage, salvage yards, heavy processing; isolated from residential areas. |
| B4 | Downtown Business | Concentrated retail & office core of regional significance. | High‑rise offices, hotels, large retailers; dense urban form; minimal yard setbacks. |
| B4S | Downtown Service | Mixed‑use downtown neighborhoods with service/light‑industrial uses. | Combines housing, commercial, parking, utilities; high density but support‑service focus. |
| B4C | Downtown Commercial | Wide range of large commercial uses in downtown. | Major shopping/entertainment complexes, corporate offices; high‑rise allowed. |
| B4N | Downtown Neighborhood | High‑density residential neighborhoods on downtown edge. | Condo/apartment towers with ground‑floor services; transition from core to neighborhoods. |

## Table 2 – Built‑Form Tier Summaries

| Tier Name | Description | How It Differs from Other Tiers |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| Interior 1 | Small‑scale residential areas farthest from downtown. | Lowest intensity: 1–2.5‑story buildings, max 3–4 units; no lot combination for larger projects. |
| Interior 2 | Low‑scale neighborhoods that can absorb slightly more housing. | Same height as Interior 1 but allows limited lot combination for small apartments. |
| Interior 3 | Residential areas closer to transit or downtown. | Up to 3 stories; supports apartments on single lots; denser than Interior 1/2. |
| Corridor 3 | Low‑rise mixed‑use/apartment buildings along transit routes. | Similar height to Interior 3 but encourages commercial/residential mix along corridors. |
| Corridor 4 | Moderate corridor scale along busy streets or historic transit ways. | Up to ~4 stories; first mid‑rise tier, more FAR and allowed density than Corridor 3. |
| Corridor 6 | Higher corridor scale near major transit and station areas. | Up to 6 stories; greater FAR; significant jump from Corridor 4 in potential units/height. |
| Transit 10 | Mid‑/high‑rise near light‑rail stations and transit‑rich areas. | Up to 10 stories; roughly doubles height of Corridor 6; high‑density mixed‑use. |
| Transit 15 | High‑rise development in transit nodes near downtown. | Up to 15 stories; adds 5 stories over Transit 10; supports landmark towers. |
| Transit 20 | Very high‑rise tier for intense transit areas and near downtown. | Up to 20 stories; enables skyline‑shaping towers outside core; denser than Transit 15. |
| Transit 30 | Upper‑end transit‑oriented high‑rise adjacent to downtown core. | Up to 30 stories; bridges to downtown; 10 stories higher than Transit 20. |
| Core 50 | Central downtown office core and tallest development. | Nominal 50‑story cap (effectively unlimited); highest FAR and bulk citywide. |
| Production | Long‑term industrial & employment areas. | Focus on large‑floorplate industrial buildings; residential towers not encouraged; modest height. |
| Parks | Park and open‑space areas. | Strict limits (~2.5 stories); buildings only for park use; priority on landscape preservation. |
